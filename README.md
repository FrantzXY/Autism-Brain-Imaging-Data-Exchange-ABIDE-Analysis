# Autism-Brain-Imaging-Data-Exchange-ABIDE-Analysis
Method of Multivariate Data Analysis (STA437H1) Final Project.

This dataset contains brain activity recordings from 47 individuals who participated in a study at Yale University. The data come from functional MRI (fMRI) scans, which measure brain activity over time. Each subject has a matrix (196 × 110) representing their brain activity.

196 → The number of time points recorded during the scan.
110 → The number of brain regions tracked. In addition to the fMRI data, there is a demographic table with information about each subject:
DX_GROUP → Diagnosis (1 = Autism, 2 = Control).
AGE_AT_SCAN → Age at the time of the scan.
SEX → Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female).
Questions for Analysis: Do brain connectivity patterns differ between individuals with Autism and the Control group?
